          ‚ô•Ô∏é A higher hydration leads to a bigger crumb and thinner crust -
          broadly speaking.

          Your mileage may vary but this tends to work for me. It's an adapted
          version of

            >this recipe by Patrick Ryan</a
          >.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Put the starter, flour, salt and water in a Kitchen Aid type mixer
          </li>
          <li>
            With the dough hook attachment, mix for maybe 3-5 minutes until the
            dough becomes smooth-ish (rather than raggedy)
          </li>
          <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl</li>
          <li>
            Cover the bowl and leave until the dough has grown. How long this
            takes and how much it'll grow by all depends on your starter and the
            temperature. Warm room with active starter - maybe 3 hours
          </li>
          <li>Give your dough a very gentle knead</li>
          <li>Cover the bowl for roughly the same time as before</li>
          <li>
            When the dough has risen again, turn your oven on to 200c if it's a
            convection oven and place a pizza stone on a shelf
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the oven is hot (longer than usual since the stone needs to be
            hot too), sprinkle some flour on the stone, gently place your dough
            on the stone and score with a sharp knife
          </li>
          <li>
            Put your dough in the oven and place 3-4 ice cubes in the bottom of
            the oven to create steam
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for ~40 minutes or until the bread makes a nice hollow noise
            when tapped on the bottom.
          </li>
        </ol>
